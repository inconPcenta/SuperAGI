The album opens with "Ode to Sleep", a dynamic track that switches between rap verses and melodic choruses. The song deals with the contrast between the darkness of the night and the light of the day, and how the narrator struggles to find peace in either. The song also introduces the recurring motif of the "blurryface", a personification of the narrator's insecurities and fears.
 
The next track is "Holding on to You", the lead single from the album. The song is an upbeat anthem that celebrates the power of music and faith to overcome one's demons. The song features a catchy hook that samples "Lean wit It, Rock wit It" by Dem Franchize Boyz, and a rap bridge that references "Entertain Us" by Nirvana. The song also features a chorus sung by a choir of fans, who were invited to participate in the recording session.
 
The third track is "Migraine", a rap-rock song that describes the narrator's experience with migraines and anxiety. The song compares the pain of a migraine to a war inside one's head, and how the narrator tries to cope with it by writing songs. The song also expresses gratitude for the support of the fans and the bandmate, who help the narrator survive.
  
The fourth track is "House of Gold", the third single from the album. The song is a ukulele-driven folk-pop song that expresses the narrator's love and devotion for his mother. The song promises to take care of his mother when she grows old, and to build her a house of gold where she can be happy. The song also features a trumpet solo by Jon Bellion, who co-produced the song.
 
The fifth track is "Car Radio", the fourth single from the album. The song is a minimalist electro-pop song that explores the power of silence and noise. The song tells the story of how the narrator's car radio was stolen, and how he now has to face his thoughts without any distraction. The song builds up to an intense rap verse that reveals the narrator's existential angst and fear of death.
 
The sixth track is "Semi-Automatic", a synth-pop song that reflects on the narrator's dual nature. The song admits that the narrator is not a perfect person, and that he sometimes acts impulsively and irrationally. The song also acknowledges that the narrator needs help from others to control his emotions and impulses. The song features a chorus that repeats the phrase "I'm never what I like", suggesting the narrator's dissatisfaction with himself.
